# Odin-TicTacToe
Create Tic Tac Toe browser game as part of The Odin Project.

I will use this file for brainstorming and to determin, how I will approach this project.

I skipped the "Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names" part, because I think it would just make the Interface more complicated and I like the basic look of it as it is.

Furthermore I did not "include a button to start/restart the game", that is not always visible, for the same reason as before. I added a restart button after the game has finnished.
